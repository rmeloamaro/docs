# Upgrading to Rundeck 3.4

::: tip
This document highlights changes for users upgrading **_from_ Rundeck 3.3**.
See other [Upgrading](/upgrading/index.md) Documents if you are upgrading from 3.2 or earlier.

## Package Repositories

Package repositories have moved! Please read [the new instructions for downloading Rundeck](/learning/howto/migrate-to-rundeck-packages-repo.md) from our new package repositories.

## DB Migration

Rundeck now uses the [Database Migration plugin](http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-database-migration/3.0.x/index.html) to manage database changes which provides structure and process to database schema changes.  Previously, database changes were applied when the `dataSource.dbCreate` property located in the _rundeck-config.properties_ was set to `update`. This property should be set to `none` moving forward (or removed). In addition, the property `grails.plugin.databasemigration.updateOnStart` should be set to `true` moving forward from 3.4.0.

_Upgrading from to Rundeck 3.4.0 from previous Rundeck Version &lt; 3.3.5_

In order to upgrade to Rundeck 3.4.0 from a version less than 3.3.5, the database must be brought up to an appropriate state using the previous database migration method. The following steps should be performed in order:

1. Backup the rundeck database
1. Add the following two properties in the _rundeck-config.properties_ file:
    1. `dataSource.dbCreate=update`
    1. `grails.plugin.databasemigration.updateOnStart=false`
1. Start Rundeck 3.4.0
1. Once Rundeck is fully started, Shutdown Rundeck 3.4.0
1. Remove the previously added `dataSource.dbCreate=update` setting from rundeck-config.properties.
1. Change the `grails.plugin.databasemigration.updateOnStart` setting to `=true`.
1. Restart Rundeck 3.4.0.  Once initialization is complete, Rundeck is ready for use

_Upgrading from to Rundeck 3.4.0 from previous Rundeck Version >= 3.3.5_

1. Backup the rundeck database
1. Start Rundeck 3.4.0
1. Once initialization is complete, Rundeck is ready for use

## API v11 (New Minimum Version)

Version 3.4.0 removed support for API v10 and below. The minimum API version is now v11. This is a potential breaking change for customers automating Rundeck via the API.  It is recommended to check any automation and confirm that all API calls are using API version 11 or higher.

`http://localhost:4440/api/<APIVERSION>/projects`

In the example above make sure the value at `<APIVERSION>` is 11 or higher.

## Project ACLs for Key Storage
Project ACLs for Key Storage implements a new dynamic within the Key Storage component.  If the existing Key Storage (from version 3.3 and previous) is organized by project name (e.g. `keys/project-name/folder/key) `care should be taken to ensure that rights are properly granted.  [More information about this feature can be found here](/administration/security/project-acl.md).

## Enterprise ACL Storage Layer (Commercial)

Rundeck Enterprise 3.4.0 adds a more efficient Enterprise ACL Storage Layer, which improves application performance if you have many ACLs. This feature is enabled by default and will automatically transfer ACLs from the Core ACL Storage Layer at startup if they exist. Newly added or changed ACLs will use the new Enterprise ACL Storage Layer. The new storage layer stores ACLs in the database in a format that allows them to be queried more efficiently, and improves performance when there are many ACLs. A caveat is that if regular expressions are used in any of the `by:` or `context:` clauses of ACLs, those ACLs cannot be queried efficiently, and remain stored only in the Core storage layer. Regular expressions are detected by a simple check for characters common to regular expressions such as `+`, `.`, `*` etc. If you have a `.` in usernames or group names, and do not want it to be treated as a regular expression, you should use a [URN in the by clause explicitly](/manual/document-format-reference/aclpolicy-v10.md#by).

This feature can be toggled with these two feature flags:

- Enable or disable the Enterprise ACL Storage Layer:
    `rundeck.feature.enterpriseacl.enabled=false`
- Enable or disable automatic Transfer between the Core and Enterprise Storage layers at startup:
    `rundeck.feature.enterpriseacltransfer.enabled=false`

The Transfer feature flag will determine whether to automatically transfer ACLs between the Enterprise and Core ACL Storage Layers at Rundeck startup. When the Enterprise ACL Storage Layer feature is enabled, any ACLs that can be transferred will be transferred out of Core and into the Enterprise storage layer. Conversely, when the Enterprise ACL Storage Layer feature flag is disabled, ACLs will be transferred back to the Core storage layer.

If the Transfer feature flag is disabled, no ACLs will be automatically transferred. You can choose to enable the Enterprise ACL Storage Layer while not enabling the automatic transfer, and only newly created or modified ACLs will use the new storage layer.

Note: if you **disable** the Enterprise ACL Storage Layer feature, but **enable** the Transfer feature and restart, any ACLs in the new storage layer will be automatically transferred back to the Core storage layer.

## Removed Support for File System Based project definitions

The configuration value `rundeck.projectsStorageType=filesystem` or file is no longer supported. This mode was a legacy mode where Project definitions were stored on the filesystem in a directory with a `project.properties` file. The Rundeck projects storage type `db` has been the default since Rundeck 3.0, and is required for any clustering behavior. This change may only affect you if you are upgrading a legacy configuration of a solo Rundeck server.

If you are using this mode, you will see a warning at startup, and projects will be converted to DB storage automatically.

Known file resources stored in each project's directory, such as readme/message-of-the-day and aclpolicy files, will be imported to the DB storage automatically.

You can remove the `rundeck.projectsStorageType` configuration key from your rundeck-config.properties file

## JIRA Plugins Require Updated Authentication (Commercial)

>Note: These steps also apply to Rundeck version 3.3.13

The JIRA Plugins now require an authentication token as opposed to the password used to login to the account. However, there are two options for proceeding with the authentication token.

::: tabs
@tab Configuration Management (Commercial)

Use the enterprise configuration management to configure the properties centrally and share with all cluster members. ([Link To learn more about this option](/manual/configuration-mgmt/configmgmt.md#managing-configuration))

1. Create a Key Store entry with the API Token.
1. Open **System Menu > Configuration Management**
1. Set **JIRA Login Name**, **JIRA Auth token** (use key path from step 1 in plain text), and **JIRA base URL**.
1. **_Remove_** any JIRA plugin settings from Project Configuration, `rundeck-conifg.properties`, `framework.properties`, and/or individual step configuration.

The above steps will only work for Job Steps.  Use _Configuration File Updates_ tab for Notification Plugins.

@tab Configuration File Updates

Edit project/framework settings and update the JIRA password properties to use auth_token as opposed to password.

First, create a Key Store entry with the API Token. Then edit the Project or Step settings individually.  An example configuration for using the auth_token as opposed to the password property would look like this:

`project.plugin.WorkflowStep.jira-assigned-issue.password=myJiraPassword`

changes to...

`project.plugin.WorkflowStep.jira-assigned-issue.auth_token=path/to/auth_token`

(“path/to/auth_token”) is a Key Storage path, not the token value.

**Note:** The JIRA Notification plugin will continue using the password property:

`project.plugin.Notification.jira-create-issue-notif.password=mytokenvalue`

The token value is the actual value, not a key storage path.
